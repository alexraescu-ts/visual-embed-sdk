This page explains, through an example, how to embed a ThoughtSpot Pinboard in your Web page, portal, or application.
////
To build this sample, you must have access to a text editor and a ThoughtSpot instance with a visualization.
Experience working with Javascript also helps.

== Import the JavaScript library
In your .html page, include the JavaScript file in the `<script>` tag under `<head>`:
[source, javascript]
----
<script type="text/javascript" src="<file-location>/<file-name>.js"></script>
----
////

== Import the PinboardEmbed package
Import the PinboardEmbed SDK library to your application environment:

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/embed-sdk';
----
////
== Import styles
[source,javascript]
[source,javascript]
----
import "./styles.css"
----
////
== Add the embed domain

To allow your client application to connect to ThoughtSpot:

. Configure the URL with ThoughtSpot hostname or IP address.
. Specify the authentication method to use for authenticating application users.
+
[source, javascript]
----
init
    ({
        thoughtSpotHost:"https://<hostname>:<port>",
        authType: AuthType.SSO,
    });
----
+
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.

+
authType::
_String_. Authentication type. Valid values are:

+
[horizontal]
SSO::
Enables SAML SSO authentication method.
AuthServer::
Trusted authentication method. The trusted authentication method enables applications to exchange secure tokens and grant access to the embedded content. If this authentication method is used, define the `authEndpoint`  attribute.
authEndpoint::
_String_. The endpoint URL of the authentication server.
None::
Requires no authentication. The user must already be logged in to ThoughtSpot before interacting with the embedded content.
+
This approach is used only for testing client applications. Do not use this in production environments.

== Construct the embed content
[source,JavaScript]
----
 const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed("#embed", {
	frameParams: {
		width: 1280,
		height: 720
	},
    disabledActions: [],
    disabledActionReason: '<reason for disabling>'
    hiddenActions: [],
});
----
frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the iframe containing the pinboard.

fullHeight::
_Boolean_. Adjusts the height of the embedded widget to fit the entire pinboard.

disabledActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to be disabled on the Pinboards page.
+

For example, to disable the *Present* action from the *More* (*...*) menu, specify the `present` string in the  `disabledActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
disabledActions: Action.present
----
+
++++
<a href="{{tshost}}/#/everywhere/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_parent">Try it in Playground</a>
++++
hiddenActions::
_Array of strings_. The action menu items to hide on the Pinboards page.
+

For example, to hide *Add filters* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the `addFilter` string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.

+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: Action.addFilter
----
+
++++
<a href="{{tshost}}/#/everywhere/playground/pinboard?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_parent">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

disabledActionReason::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on a pinboard page.

For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling or hiding menu items, see link:/typedoc/enums/action.html[Actions].

== Render the embedded pinboard
Construct the URL for the embedded pinboard and render the embedded content:
[source,JavaScript]
----
    pinboardEmbed.render({
    pinboardId: '<%=pinboardGUID%>',
    runtimeFilters: []
});

----

pinboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the pinboard.
////
vizId [small]_optional_::
_String_. The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of a visualization added to the pinboard.
////
runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the Pinboard page loads.
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization in a pinboard and pass filter specifications in the URL query parameters.     
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----
runtimeFilters: [{
  columnName: 'color',
  operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
  values: [ 'red' ]
  }]
----
Runtime filters have several operators for filtering your embedded visualizations.
+

[width="50%" cols="1,2,1"]
[options='header']
|===
|Operator|Description|Number of Values

| `EQ`
| equals
| 1

| `NE`
| does not equal
| 1

| `LT`
| less than
| 1

| `LE`
| less than or equal to
| 1

| `GT`
| greater than
| 1

| `GE`
| greater than or equal to
| 1

| `CONTAINS`
| contains
| 1

| `BEGINS_WITH`
| begins with
| 1

| `ENDS_WITH`
| ends with
| 1

| `BW_INC_MAX`
| between inclusive of the higher value
| 2

| `BW_INC_MIN`
| between inclusive of the lower value
| 2

| `BW_INC`
| between inclusive
| 2

| `BW`
| between non-inclusive
| 2
|===

<a href="{{tshost}}/#/everywhere/playground/pinboard?runtimeFilters=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_parent">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

== Subscribe to events
Register event handlers and subscribe to events triggered by the embedded pinboard:
[source,javascript]
----

  pinboardEmbed.on(EventType.init, showLoader)
  pinboardEmbed.on(EventType.load, hideLoader)

----
////
==== Event Types
init::
The visualization iframe is initiaized.
load::
The visualization iframe is loaded.
filtersChanged::
New filters applied for the visualization
drilldown::
Visualization drilldown is initiated.
////

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a pinboard embedded in your application.
* Verify the rendition.
* If you have disabled a menu item, verify if the menu command is disabled on the *Pinboards* page.
* Verify the runtime filters.

== Code sample

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/embed-sdk';

init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});

const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(
    document.getElementById('ts-embed'),
    {
        frameParams: {
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        },
    });

pinboardEmbed.render({
    pinboardId: 'f4a4e205-3b43-4b77-8ec0-8723da49ce1d',

});
