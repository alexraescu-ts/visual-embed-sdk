:page-description: Embed Data using REST APIs

To get data out from ThoughtSpot and embed it in a web page, portal, or application, you can use the data APIs. The data REST APIs return data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

To construct the URL for making a REST API call for embedding a pinboard or visualization:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the pinboard from which you want to get data.
. Find the ID number of the object you want to get the data from.
+ 
To embed a pinboard, click the ellipses (...) icon, and select *Copy embed link*.

+
To embed a visualization:

.. Navigate to the table or chart
.. Click the ellipses (...) icon in the upper right corner of the table or chart.
.. Click *Copy embed link* icon.
+

. Copy the ID number from the link.
Paste it somewhere so that you can use it later to construct the URL for the REST API call.

+
If the object is a pinboard, copy the identifier that appears after `viz/`.

+

+
For visualizations (table or chart), copy the IDs that appear after `viz/`. 
+

. Construct the URL. 
+
For a pinboard, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>
----

+
For a visualization, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
----

. To apply filters to the data, use runtime filters.

+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
----
http://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=color&op1=EQ&val1=red
----

. After you construct the URL, send a POST request to get data from ThoughtSpot.
+
The Data REST API returns the data formatted as JSON.
. Retrieve the data from the JSON and embed it in your Web page, Web portal, or application.
