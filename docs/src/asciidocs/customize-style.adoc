[#font-customize]
== Customize fonts for visualizations

You can add and edit fonts to customize the appearance of your charts and tables.
You can set the default fonts of your system by customizing *Chart Visualization Fonts* and *Table Visualization Fonts*.

[NOTE]
Before you begin, make sure you have the WOFF files available for the fonts you want to use.

=== Important points to note
* To add a custom font, your font must be defined in a Web Open Font Format (`WOFF`) file.

* If you change table fonts, older tables retain their previous fonts.

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. To update fonts for charts, go to *Chart Visualization Fonts*, and select a chart label.
. To update fonts for tables, go to *Table Visualization Fonts*.
+
By default, the font changes are applied to all values in the table cells.

+
The system displays the *Custom Font* dialog.

. Click the *Custom Font* field.
+
The system displays the file finder.

image::./images/set-background-color.png[Application Background Color]
. Use the color menu to choose your new background color.

+
You can also add a HEX color code.

[#nav-panel]
== Customize navigation panel
If you have embedded the full ThoughtSpot application, you can customize the navigation panel color to match your company's color scheme.
The custom background color is applied to the navigation panel of the ThoughtSpot application.

To choose a background color for the navigation panel:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. Click the background color box under *Navigation Panel Color*.
. Use the color menu to choose your new background color.
+

[#chart-color]
== Customize color palette for charts
You can define a set of primary and secondary colors for chart visualizations. The customized color palette is used for all visualizations, such as search answers and charts in your pinboards.

To change the color palette for charts:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Styles*.
. Click the background color box under *Chart Color Palettes*.
. Click the color you would like to change in the *primary* color palette, and use the color menu to choose your new color.
+
You can also add a HEX color code.

+
All of the colors in the primary color palette are used in a chart before any from the secondary palette are used.
Therefore, the primary palette usually consists of primary colors.

. Click the color you would like to change in the *secondary* color palette, and use the color menu to choose your new color.
You can also add a HEX color code.
+
The colors from the secondary color palette are used after all of the colors have been exhausted from the primary palette.
Therefore, the secondary palette usually consists of secondary colors.

=== Disable color rotation

You can disable color rotation for single-color charts.
If you disable color rotation, ThoughtSpot generates single-color charts in the order of your color palette, left to right.
If you leave color rotation enabled, ThoughtSpot generates the color of single-color charts randomly.

To change the footer text:

////
== How to specify the behavior or clickable links in data

There is a system-wide setting which determines what happens when a user clicks on a link within the data.
When your data includes URLs, they display as clickable links in ThoughtSpot tables.
By default, clicking on a link opens the URL in a separate tab.
But there is a system-wide setting that can be changed to open the links within the context of where they appear.

Consider how the links open, by type:

* Link in search result table in ThoughtSpot-Same browser tab as ThoughtSpot application
* Link in table embedded in an <iframe> - Same <iframe> that contains the table
* Link in full ThoughtSpot application embedded in an <iframe> - Same <iframe> that contains the application
