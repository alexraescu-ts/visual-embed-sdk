== How to specify the behavior or clickable links in data

There is a system-wide setting which determines what happens when a user clicks on a link within the data.
When your data includes URLs, they display as clickable links in ThoughtSpot tables.
By default, clicking on a link opens the URL in a separate tab.
But there is a system-wide setting that can be changed to open the links within the context of where they appear.

Consider how the links open, by type:

* Link in search result table in ThoughtSpot-Same browser tab as ThoughtSpot application
* Link in table embedded in an <iframe> - Same <iframe> that contains the table
* Link in full ThoughtSpot application embedded in an <iframe> - Same <iframe> that contains the application


== Reset Styles
Your changes take effect either immediately, or after you refresh the browser.
You can revert your changes by using the *Reset* button that appears when you move your cursor to the right of the setting.

. Click the *Reset* button on the upper right hand side of the sections if you would like to bring back the default logos.
