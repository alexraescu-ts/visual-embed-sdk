:page-description: Embed Data using REST APIs

To get data out from ThoughtSpot objects and embed it in a web page, portal, or application, you can use the data APIs. The data REST APIs return data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.

== Embed pinboard or visualization data
To embed a pinboard or visualization, construct the URL for the REST API call:

. Log in to ThoughtSpot from a browser.
. Navigate to the pinboard from which you want to get data.
. Find the ID number of the object you want to get the data from.
+ 
To embed a pinboard, click the ellipses (...) icon, and then select *Copy embed link*.

+
To embed a visualization:

.. Navigate to the table or chart
.. Click the ellipses (...) icon in the upper right corner of the table or chart.
.. Click *Copy embed link* icon.
+

. Copy the ID number from the link.
Paste it somewhere so that you can use it later to construct the URL for the REST API call.

+
If the object is a pinboard, copy the identifier that appears after `viz/`.

+
For visualizations (table or chart), copy the IDs that appear after `viz/`. 
+

. Construct the URL. 
+
For a pinboard, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>
----

+
For a visualization, the URL is as follows:

+
----
https://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
----

. To apply filters to the data, use runtime filters.

+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization in a pinboard, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:

+
----
http://<base-uri>/callosum/v1/tspublic/v1/pinboarddata
?id=<pinboard_id>&vizid=%5B<visualization_id>%5D
&col1=color&op1=EQ&val1=red
----

. After you construct the URL, send a POST request to get data from ThoughtSpot.

+
The Data REST API returns the data formatted as JSON.
. Retrieve the data from the JSON and embed it in your Web page, Web portal, or application.

== Obtain search data

Using the REST APIs, you can search data from the ThoughtSpot application. To obtain this data, you do not have to save a search result to a pinboard and then reference it using the visualizationâ€™s URL. Using the REST API service, you can allow your application to pull data directly from ThoughtSpot in an ad hoc fashion.

To obtain search data from the data sources configured in ThoughtSpot application, you must embed the ThoughtSpot search functionality using the  xref:visual-embed-sdk.adoc[Visual Embed SDK].

Data retrieved using the Embedded Search API is returned as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). You must parse the JSON to get the data values you need, generally using JavaScript in the receiving application.

To subscribe to results for all the searches the user does in the embedded ThoughtSpot application, use the API JavaScript function `subscribeToData( )`. This will allow your page to listen for data coming from ThoughtSpot.

Now when a user searches, the <iframe> sends data to the subscription. The parent web page or application receives the data as JSON, and can do whatever you want with it.

You can set up your web page or application to display or otherwise act on the data it receives from the subscription.

To test it out, do a search in the embedded ThoughtSpot application to retrieve the data. Your application should act on the data in the way you set it up to do so.
