:page-description: Trusted Authentication

If your organization has a trusted authentication server, you can use it to authenticate the users who request access to the embedded ThoughtSpot application. After authenticating a user, the trusted authenticator server or service obtains an authentication token from ThoughtSpot on that userâ€™s behalf. This ensures that the user authentication persists across all subsequent user sessions.

[NOTE]
To use the trusted authentication method, you must enable CORS and add the authentication server domain to the allowed list of domains. For more information, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

== Trusted authentication workflow
The embed user authentication workflow with trusted authentication service involves the following steps:

. A user logs into the client application and requests access to an embedded ThoughtSpot component.
. The client application sends a request for a user token from the trusted authenticator.
+
Your server application must determine the following:

 ** if the requestor has authenticated with your server.
 ** which user (`username`) is making the request.
 ** what is being requested: an object, page, or the entire ThoughtSpot application.
 ** whether the requesting `username` matches a `username` on the ThoughtSpot application.
+

.  The trusted authenticator server intercepts the request, authenticates the user, and requests a token from ThoughtSpot on the user's behalf.
+
----
 POST https://<base-uri>/tspublic/v1/session/auth/token
----
+
This POST request method includes the following attributes:
[horizontal]
secret_key::
A required `formData` parameter containing the authentication token string provided by the ThoughtSpot application server.
username::
A required `formData` parameter containing a string which is the user's `username` on ThoughtSpot.
access_level::
A required `formData` parameter containing one of `FULL` or `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW`.
id::
An optional `formData` parameter containing the identifier of the embedded ThoughtSpot object.
This is only required if you specified `REPORT_BOOK_VIEW` for the `access_level` parameter.
+

. ThoughtSpot verifies the authenticator server's request and returns a user token.
. The authenticator returns the user token to the client, which uses it to complete the user request.
. The client application forwards the request and the user token to the ThoughtSpot application server.

GET https://<base-uri>/collosum/v1/session/login/token?username=<user>&auth_token=<token>&redirect_url=<full-encoded-url-with-auth-token>
----
The request URL includes the following attributes:

username::
_String_. The `username` of the user requesting access to ThoughtSpot.

auth_token::
_String_. The authentication token obtained for the user from the trusted authentication service.

redirect_url::
_String_. The URL to which the user is redirected after successful authentication. The URL is fully encoded and includes the authentication token obtained for the user.
+
For example, if the user has requested access to a specific visualization on a pinboard, the redirect URL includes the domains to which the user is redirected, the auth token string obtained for the user, visualization ID, and pinboard ID.
+

----
https://<redirect-domain>/?authtoken=<user_auth_token>&embedApp=true&primaryNavHidden=true#/embed/viz/<pinboard_id>/<viz-id>
----
[NOTE]
The request URL includes the `auth_token` attribute, whereas the redirect URL uses the `authtoken` attribute.

. ThoughtSpot validates the token and returns the information that the authenticated user has requested.

The following illustration depicts the trusted authentication workflow:

== Enable trusted authentication
You need ThoughtSpot admin privileges to enable trusted authentication.

. Log in to the ThoughtSpot.
. Click the *Develop* tab.
. Under *Customizations*, click *Settings*.
. To enable trusted authentication, turn on the toggle.
+
An authentication token is generated.

. Click the clipboard icon to copy the token.
+
The following example shows a ThoughtSpot-generated authentication token key.
+
----
b0cb26a0-351e-40b4-9e42-00fa2265d50c
----
This key is required for making API calls to get a token for ThoughtSpot users.

. Store the key in a secure location.
. Click *Save Changes*.

////
Add instructions on overwriting tokens.
Every time you make API calls to initiate trusted authentication, the token is overwritten and a new one is returned.
////

== Disable trusted authentication

To disable trusted authentication, follow these steps:

. Go to *Develop* > *Customizations* > *Settings*.
. On the *Settings* page, turn off the *Trusted Authentication* toggle.
+
A pop-window appears and prompts you to confirm the disable action.

. Click *Disable*.

+
When you disable trusted authentication, the validity of your existing authentication token expires. Your application will become inoperable until you add the new token to it.
To generate a new token, re-enable trusted authentication.
