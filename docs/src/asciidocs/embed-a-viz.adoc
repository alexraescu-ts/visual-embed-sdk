This page explains how to embed a ThoughtSpot visualization, such as tables and charts, in your Web page, portal, or application.

////
To build this sample, you must have access to a text editor and a ThoughtSpot instance with a visualization.
Experience working with Javascript also helps.
////

== Import the PinboardEmbed package
Import the visualization SDK library to your application environment:

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/embed-sdk';
----

== Add the embed domain

To allow your client application to connect to ThoughtSpot:

. Configure the URL with ThoughtSpot hostname or IP address.
. Specify the authentication method to use for authenticating application users.
+
[source,javascript]
----
init
    ({
        thoughtSpotHost:"https://<hostname>:<port>",
        authType: AuthType.SSO,
    });
----
+
thoughtSpotHost::
_String_. Hostname or IP address of the ThoughtSpot application.
+
authType::
_String_. Authentication type. Valid values are:

+
[horizontal]
SSO::
Enables SAML SSO authentication method.
AuthServer::
Trusted authentication method. The trusted authentication method enables applications to exchange secure tokens to grant access to the embedded content. If this authentication method is used, define the `authEndpoint`  attribute.
authEndpoint::
_String_. The endpoint URL of the authentication server.
None::
Requires no authentication. The user must already be logged into ThoughtSpot before interacting with the embedded content.
+
This approach is used only for testing client applications. Do not use this in production environments.

== Construct the embed content
[source,JavaScript]
----
 const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed("#embed", {
	frameParams: {
		width: 1280,
		height: 720
	},
	disabledActions: [],
	hiddenActions: [],
});
----


frameParams:: Sets the `width` and `height` dimensions to render the iframe containing the visualization.

disabledActions [small]_optional_::
_String_. Disables the specified action menu items from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] on the visualization page.
+

For example, to disable the *Change Title* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the  `editTitle` string in the  `disabledActions` attribute.


+
----
disabledActions: Action.editTitle
----
+
++++
<a href="{{origin}}/playground/answer?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_parent">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

hiddenActions [small]_optional_::
_String_. Hides the menu items from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu] on the visualization page.
+

For example, to hide *Download As PDF* action from the *More* menu image:./images/icon-more-10px.png[the more options menu], specify the  `downloadAsPdf` string in the `hiddenActions` attribute.


+
[source,JavaScript]
----
hiddenActions: Action.downloadAsPdf
----


+
++++
<a href="{{origin}}/playground/answer?modifyActions=true" id="preview-in-playground" target="_parent">Try it in Playground</a>
++++

disabledActionReason [small]_optional_::
_String_. Reason for disabling an action on the visualizations page.

For a complete list of action menu items and the corresponding strings to use for disabling or hiding menu items, see link:/typedoc/enums/action.html[Actions].

== Render the embedded visualization
Construct the URL for the embedded visualization and render the embedded content:
[source,JavaScript]
----
  pinboardEmbed.render({
    pinboardId: '<%=pinboardGUID%>',
    vizId: '<%=vizGUID%>'
    runtimeFilters: []
});

----

vizId::
_String_. The Global Unique Identifier (GUID) of the visualization.
pinboardId::
_String_. The GUID of the pinboard to which the visualization is pinned.
runtimeFilters [small]_optional_::
Runtime filters to be applied when the embedded visualization loads.
+
Runtime filters provide the ability to filter data at the time of retrieval. Runtime filters allow you to apply a filter to a visualization by passing filter specifications in the URL query parameters.
+
For example, to sort values equal to `red` in the `Color` column for a visualization, you can pass the runtime filter in the URL query parameters as shown here:
+
[source,javascript]
----

runtimeFilters: [{
  columnName: 'color',
  operator: RuntimeFilterOp.EQ,
  values: [ 'red' ]
  }]

----
For more information, see link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/apply-runtime-filter.html[Apply a Runtime Filter, window=_blank].

+
Runtime filters have several operators you can use to filter your embedded visualizations.

+
[width="50%" cols="1,2,1"]
[options='header']
|===
|Operator|Description|Number of Values

| `EQ`
| equals
| 1

| `NE`
| does not equal
| 1

| `LT`
| less than
| 1

| `LE`
| less than or equal to
| 1

| `GT`
| greater than
| 1

| `GE`
| greater than or equal to
| 1

| `CONTAINS`
| contains
| 1

| `BEGINS_WITH`
| begins with
| 1

| `ENDS_WITH`
| ends with
| 1

| `BW_INC_MAX`
| between inclusive of the higher value
| 2

| `BW_INC_MIN`
| between inclusive of the lower value
| 2

| `BW_INC`
| between inclusive
| 2

| `BW`
| between non-inclusive
| 2
|===

== Subscribe to events
Register event handlers to subscribe to events triggered by the embedded visualizations:

[source,javascript]
----

 pinboardEmbed.on(EventType.init, showLoader)
 pinboardEmbed.on(EventType.load, hideLoader)

----
////
==== Event Types
init::
The visualization iframe is initiaized.
load::
The visualization iframe is loaded.
filtersChanged::
New filters applied for the visualization
drilldown::
Visualization drilldown is initiated.
////

== Test the embedded workflow

* Load the client application.
* Try accessing a visualization embedded in your application.
* Verify the rendition.
* If you have disabled a menu item from the visualizations page, verify if the menu command is disabled.
* Verify the runtime filters.

== Code sample

[source,javascript]
----
import { PinboardEmbed, AuthType, init } from '@thoughtspot/embed-sdk';

init({
    thoughtSpotHost: '<%=tshost%>',
    authType: AuthType.None,
});

const pinboardEmbed = new PinboardEmbed(
    document.getElementById('ts-embed'),
    {
        frameParams: {
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        },
    });

pinboardEmbed.render({
    pinboardId: '6294b4fc-c289-412a-b458-073fcf6e4516',
    vizId: '28b73b4a-1341-4535-ab71-f76b6fe7bf92'
});
