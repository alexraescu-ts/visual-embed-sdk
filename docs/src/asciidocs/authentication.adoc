:page-description: REST API Authentication

The REST API allows you to get data out of ThoughtSpot so you can embed it in a Web page, portal, or application.
To access REST APIs, you must authenticate through SAML SSO.
For more information on configuring SAML, see xref:configure-saml.adoc[SAML SSO].

== Cross-Domain Verification

You must enable cross-domain verification when using the REST APIs.
This protects your data, so that another website cannot use a URL to get data from ThoughtSpot.
For more information on enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and whitelisting application domains, see xref:security-settings.adoc[Security settings].

== Base URI

The base URI for the REST APIs calls is:
----
https://<your-thoughtspot-hostname:port.com>
----
